# Super-resolution-classification
### Using autoencoders to improve image resolution and using them for classification on Stanford Dogs dataset.

We have delved deeper to look into how an improvement in the classification accuracy can be obtained with enhancement in the input image resolution of the training data.

We have used an autoencoder to up-scale the image resolution, followed by feeding the resultant image to the classification model.

### Part A - Super resolution 

- Training autoencoder to improve resolution of images.
- Show before-after images.

### Part B - Classification

- Train on Stanford Dogs dataset. Predict the dog breed images in data.
- Show images with predicted labels.

### Part C - Super resolution + Classification

- Enhance image resolution and train classifier model.
- Compare accuracies for image classification and super resolution enhanced image classification.
